# Command-line tools

After the python code has been install (usually using Poetry), a list of command-line tools is also installed. This 
document describes these tools. 

> These tools are also installed in the `mattermost-data-warehouse` docker image.

## Rudderstack utilities

`rudder` is the entry level command for common Rudderstack tasks. Simply running `rudder` on your bash script will 
print a help message and a list of sub-commands.

```bash
$ rudder
Usage: rudder [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Rudderstack helpers. Offers a variety of subcommands for managing
  rudderstack tables from the command line.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  list  List Rudderstack event tables for given database and schema.
  move  Move tables to target database/schema.
```

Help is available at any command/sub-command, simply by adding `-h`/`--help` at the end of the command.

Let's go over the subcommands.

### List event tables

Simply run `rudder list ...` providing the proper arguments.

The following example will list all event tables in database `RAW`, schema `mattermost_docs`:

```bash
$ rudder list RAW mattermost_docs -a cca12345.us-east-1 -u joe@doe.com -r role_name -w warehouse_small
Password: 
DOC_EVENT
NEW_TABLE
...
```

The following example will list all event tables in database `RAW`, schema `mattermost_docs` that have been
created in the past two days:

```bash
$ rudder list RAW mattermost_docs -a cca12345.us-east-1 -u joe@doe.com -r role_name -w warehouse_small --max-age 2
Password: 
NEW_TABLE
...
```

### Move tables

Move all tables listed in input file/stdin from source database/schema to target/database schema.

Simply run `rudder move ...` providing the proper arguments.

The following example will move all tables listed in `tables.txt` from `DEV.STAGING` to `ARCHIVE.OLD_STAGING`

```bash
$ rudder move DEV STAGING ARCHIVE OLD_STAGING tables.txt -a cca12345.us-east-1 -u joe@doe.com -r role_name -w warehouse_small 
Password: 
Moving DEV.STAGING.table_to_archive âœ“
...
```

If you want to use stdin rather than a file, you can specify `-` as input. Press  `[CTRL] + D` any time to stop.

Example:

```bash
$ rudder move DEV STAGING ARCHIVE OLD_STAGING - -a cca12345.us-east-1 -u joe@doe.com -r role_name -w warehouse_small 
Password: 

table_to_archive
Moving DEV.STAGING.table_to_archive âœ“
...
```


### Configuring using environment variables

Options for all subcommands can also be set using environment variables. Here's the possible configuration variables:

| Environment Variable  | Example value       | Required | Description                               |
