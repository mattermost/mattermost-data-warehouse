--tested on snowflake for consistency of arr by month week and day
--tested for parent child relationships with amounts matching salesforce
--late renewal starts when renewal closes in the next month after expiry
--added logic for late renewal when close date is <=90 later that license start 
--and resurrection for cases when close date > license start
--Expansion and contraction calculated for late renewals but not for resurrections
