      Insert or update Cloud Starter leads to Salesforce via Hightouch. Uses portal signup data submitted via
      Rudderstack. Portal data are merged with Salesforce lead data from salesforce (if any). 
      
      There are two hightouch syncs configured:
      - Leads from portal data without matching salesforce leads are stored in `cs_lead_insert` view and inserted in Salesforce ([hightouch sync](https://app.hightouch.com/mattermost-com/syncs/42125)). 
      - Leads from portal data with matching salesforce leads are stored in `cs_lead_update` view and updated in Salesforce ([hightouch sync](https://app.hightouch.com/mattermost-com/syncs/42133)).
