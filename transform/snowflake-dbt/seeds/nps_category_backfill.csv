- Display the name of the team or system admin who edited a message of a member user
- Add 'Mark as read' to the channel right click context menu
- Restrict public channel creation to team admins and system admins in the community edition
- Make it possible to delete the default custom emojis ( :bowtie:, :feelsgood:, :finnadie:, :goberserk:, :godmode:, :hurtrealbad:, :neckbeard:, :octocat:, :rage1:, :rage2:, :rage3:, :rage4:, :shipit:, :suspect: and :trollface: ), they all look terrible and I'd really appreciate for it to be possible for the system admin to just delete them.
- Allow users to set a custom status/quote
- add the capability to sign into multiple servers in the mobile app
- Make emoji-only messages larger in chat history (like discord)
- Add a page in site statistics that shows the most active public channels over a selectable time period (i.e. total number of messages in selected period)
- Add real time markdown preview when composing messages, i.e. like discord does
