          The start date of the subscription's license. The priority for deciding which field or value should be used
          for the license's start date is the following:
          - If it's an SFDC migrated license, then value of `sfdc_migrated_started_at`.
          - In case of a bug where license start date from CWS doesn't exist but end date exists, then derive it as 1 year from start.
          - If both license start and end date from CWS is equal to 0 (bug), then use current period start.
          - If a value for `license-start-date` exists, its a sales-ops set field for a licensed cloud subscription, so use that value.
          - Otherwise use value from CWS metadata.

          The end date of the subscription's license. The priority for deciding which field or value should be used for

          - If the license is marked as migrated from SFDC, then use `current_period_end_at`
          - If a value for `license-end-at` exists, its a sales-ops set field for a licensed cloud subscription, so use that value.
