      Logs from push proxy servers. Each table contains logs for each HTTP request served by the Elastic Load Balancer.
      AWS offers [documentation on the values of each field](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html).
      The logs are loaded using a Snowflake stage. An 
      [Airflow DAG](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/dags/extract/push_proxy.py)
      triggers the loading of the job. The entrypoint to the script that performs the loading is available
      [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/extract/s3_extract/push_proxy_job.py).
