      Logs from downloads of Mattermost server and client applications. Contains a single table (`log_entries`) with 
      logs from AWS CloudFront. AWS offers [documentation on the value of each field](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html#LogFileFormat).
      The logs are loaded using a Snowflake stage. An [Airflow DAG](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/airflow/dags/mattermost_dags/extract/releases.py)
      triggers loading the logs into the stage. The entrypoint to the script that performs the loading is available
      [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-data-warehouse/blob/master/extract/s3_extract/release_job.py).

    tables:
      - name: log_entries
        description: Contains the log entries. Note that the table might contain duplicate rows.
        columns:
          - name: logdate
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              The date on which the event occurred in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. For example, `2019-06-30`. The date and 
              time are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For WebSocket connections, this is the date when the
              connection closed.
          - name: logtime
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              The time when the CloudFront server finished responding to the request (in UTC), for example, `01:42:39`. 
              For WebSocket connections, this is the time when the connection is closed.
          - name: edge
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              The edge location that served the request. For WebSocket connections, this is the edge location that 
              closed the connection.
          - name: bytessent
            data_type: number
            description: |
              The number of bytes sent by the server to the client in response to the request, including headers.
          - name: cip
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              The IP address of the client that made the request. For WebSocket connections, this is the IP address of 
              the client that initiated the connection.
          - name: method
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
                The HTTP method that the viewer used to request the object. For WebSocket connections, this is the 
                method that the client used to connect to the CloudFront server.
          - name: host
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              The domain name of the CloudFront distribution, for example, `d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`.
          - name: uri
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              The portion of the URI that identifies the path and object, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg`.
          - name: status
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              Contains one of the following values:
              - The HTTP status code that CloudFront returned to the viewer. For example, `200`.
              - `000`, which indicates that the viewer closed the connection before the server could respond to the request. If the viewer closes the connection after the server starts to send the response, this field contains the HTTP status code of the response that the server started to send.
          - name: creferrer
            data_type: varchar
            description: |

          - name: x_edge_result_type
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              How the server classified the response after the last byte left the server. In some cases, the result
              type can change between the time that the server is ready to send the response and the time that it 
              finishes sending the response. Possible values include:
              - `Hit` – The server served the object to the viewer from the cache.
              - `RefreshHit` – The server found the object in the cache but the object had expired, so the server contacted the origin to verify that the cache had the latest version of the object.
              - `Miss` – The request could not be satisfied by an object in the cache, so the server forwarded the request to the origin and returned the result to the viewer.
              - `LimitExceeded` – The request was denied because a CloudFront quota (formerly referred to as a limit) was exceeded.
              - `CapacityExceeded` – The server returned an HTTP 503 status code because it didn't have enough capacity at the time of the request to serve the object.
              - `Error` – Typically, this means the request resulted in a client error (the value of the sc-status field is in the 4xx range) or a server error (the value of the sc-status field is in the 5xx range). If the value of the sc-status field is 200, or if the value of this field is Error and the value of the x-edge-response-result-type field is not Error, it means the HTTP request was successful but the client disconnected before receiving all of the bytes.
              - `Redirect` – The server redirected the viewer from HTTP to HTTPS according to the distribution settings.
          - name: x_edge_request_id
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              A unique identifier for the request. For WebSocket connections, this is the unique identifier for the connection.
          - name: x_host_header
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              The value of the Host header in the request. For example, `d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`.
          - name: protocol
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
                The protocol of the viewer request (http, https, ws, or wss).
          - name: cs_bytes
            data_type: number
            description: |
              The total number of bytes that the viewer sent in the request, including headers.
          - name: time_taken
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              The number of seconds (to the thousandth of a second, for example, 0.082) from when the server receives 
              the viewer's request to when the server writes the last byte of the response to the output queue, as
              measured on the server. From the perspective of the viewer, the total time to get the full response will
              be longer than this value because of network latency and TCP buffering.
          - name: x_forwarded_for
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              If the viewer used an HTTP proxy or a load balancer to send the request, the value of the c-ip field is 
              the IP address of the proxy or load balancer. In that case, this field is the IP address of the viewer
              that originated the request. This field can contain multiple comma-separated IP addresses. Each IP address
              can be an IPv4 address (for example, 192.0.2.183) or an IPv6 address (for example, 
              2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334).
              If the viewer did not use an HTTP proxy or a load balancer, the value of this field is a hyphen (-).
          - name: ssl_protocol
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              When the request is made using HTTPS, this field contains the SSL/TLS protocol that the viewer negotiated.
          - name: ssl_cipher
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
                When the request is made using HTTPS, this field contains the SSL/TLS cipher that the viewer negotiated.
          - name: x_edge_response_result_type
            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              How the server classified the response after the last byte left the server. See `x_edge_result_type`.
          - name: cs_protocol_version
            data_type: varchar
            description: |

              HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2.0, and HTTP/3.0.
          - name: file_status
            data_type: varchar

            data_type: varchar
            description: |
              Always null in this use case.
