    columns:
      - name: log_date
        description: |
          The date on which the event occurred.
      - name: log_at
        description: |
          The timestamp when the CloudFront server finished responding to the request (in UTC).
      - name: edge
        description: |
          The edge location that served the request. For WebSocket connections, this is the edge location that 
          closed the connection.
      - name: response_bytes
        description: |
          The number of bytes sent by the server to the client in response to the request, including headers.
      - name: client_ip
        description: |
          The IP address of the client that made the request. For WebSocket connections, this is the IP address of 
          the client that initiated the connection.
      - name: htto_method
        description: |
            The HTTP method that the viewer used to request the object. For WebSocket connections, this is the 
            method that the client used to connect to the CloudFront server.
      - name: host
        description: |
          The domain name of the CloudFront distribution, for example, `d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`.
      - name: uri
        description: |
          The portion of the URI that identifies the path and object, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg`.
      - name: status
        description: |
          Contains one of the following values:
          - The HTTP status code that CloudFront returned to the viewer. For example, `200`.
          - `000`, which indicates that the viewer closed the connection before the server could respond to the request. If the viewer closes the connection after the server starts to send the response, this field contains the HTTP status code of the response that the server started to send.
      - name: referrer_url
        description: |
          The value of the Referer field in the request header. For example, `http://www.example.com/start.html`.
      - name: user_agent
        description: |
          The value of the User-Agent field in the request header. For example, `Mozilla/4.0`.
      - name: query_string
        description: |
          The query string portion of the URI, if any. For example, `?value1=abc&value2=123`.
      - name: cookie
        description: |
          The Cookie header in the request, including name-value pairs and any attributes.
      - name: x_edge_result_type
        description: |
          How the server classified the response after the last byte left the server. In some cases, the result
          type can change between the time that the server is ready to send the response and the time that it 
          finishes sending the response. Possible values include:
          - `Hit` – The server served the object to the viewer from the cache.
          - `RefreshHit` – The server found the object in the cache but the object had expired, so the server contacted the origin to verify that the cache had the latest version of the object.
          - `Miss` – The request could not be satisfied by an object in the cache, so the server forwarded the request to the origin and returned the result to the viewer.
          - `LimitExceeded` – The request was denied because a CloudFront quota (formerly referred to as a limit) was exceeded.
          - `CapacityExceeded` – The server returned an HTTP 503 status code because it didn't have enough capacity at the time of the request to serve the object.
          - `Error` – Typically, this means the request resulted in a client error (the value of the sc-status field is in the 4xx range) or a server error (the value of the sc-status field is in the 5xx range). If the value of the sc-status field is 200, or if the value of this field is Error and the value of the x-edge-response-result-type field is not Error, it means the HTTP request was successful but the client disconnected before receiving all of the bytes.
          - `Redirect` – The server redirected the viewer from HTTP to HTTPS according to the distribution settings.
      - name: x_edge_request_id
        description: |
          A unique identifier for the request. For WebSocket connections, this is the unique identifier for the connection.
      - name: x_host_header
        description: |
          The value of the Host header in the request. For example, `d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`.
      - name: protocol
        description: |
            The protocol of the viewer request (http, https, ws, or wss).
      - name: request_bytes
        description: |
          The total number of bytes that the viewer sent in the request, including headers.
      - name: time_taken
        description: |
          The number of seconds (to the thousandth of a second, for example, 0.082) from when the server receives 
          the viewer's request to when the server writes the last byte of the response to the output queue, as
          measured on the server. From the perspective of the viewer, the total time to get the full response will
          be longer than this value because of network latency and TCP buffering.
      - name: x_forwarded_for
        description: |
          If the viewer used an HTTP proxy or a load balancer to send the request, the value of the c-ip field is 
          the IP address of the proxy or load balancer. In that case, this field is the IP address of the viewer
          that originated the request. This field can contain multiple comma-separated IP addresses. Each IP address
          can be an IPv4 address (for example, 192.0.2.183) or an IPv6 address (for example, 
          2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334).
          If the viewer did not use an HTTP proxy or a load balancer, the value of this field is a hyphen (-).
      - name: ssl_protocol
        description: |
          When the request is made using HTTPS, this field contains the SSL/TLS protocol that the viewer negotiated.
      - name: ssl_cipher
        description: |
            When the request is made using HTTPS, this field contains the SSL/TLS cipher that the viewer negotiated.
      - name: x_edge_response_result_type
        description: |
