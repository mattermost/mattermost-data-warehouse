      Contains statistics about daily, weekly and monthly active users for each date. Statistics are stored per server.
      Telemetry data are used to identify user activity.
      
      Also offers:
      - Desktop/server DAU/WAU/MAU. Includes all telemetry from within the app, plus any user telemetry that might be originating from server side, excluding old servers (pre 5.23.0).
      - Legacy DAU/WAU/MAU. Same as desktop/server, but includes telemetry up to 5.25.0.
      
      > Version 5.23.0 - 5.25.0 of Mattermost server transmitted telemetry both to Segment and Rudderstack.
