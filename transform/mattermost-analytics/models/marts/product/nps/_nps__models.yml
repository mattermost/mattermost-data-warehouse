  - name: fct_nps_score
    description: |
      This model contains NPS user count metrics on server parameters (server_id, server_version, user_role) sent from Rudderstack and Segment sources.
      Score is calculated for servers after April 2020, since some servers from Segment reported the user_id's as empty prior.
      This raises divide by zero error with the NPS score calculation.
