selectors:
  - name: skip_views_but_test_views
    description: >
      A default selector that will exclude materializing views without skipping tests on views. This is useful in
      case views do not change that often (i.e. staging models). New and modified views can execute on a separate
      job whenever they are merged to main branch.
