  - name: join_tracks_event_tables
    description: |
      A macro that joins event tables to a single table, keeping the extra columns. 
      
      Rudderstack stores one row in two tables for each event. 
      - `tracks`, which holds generic information about the event, and
      - `event_name`, which holds the extra user defined properties. 
      
      This macro joins all tables except the default tables defined in
      [warehouse schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema). It also
      allows for filtering which columns to keep. This can be useful in scenarios where events share properties (i.e. 
      indicating event hierarchy, A/B test allocations etc).

    arguments:
      - name: schema
        type: string
        description: The schema that contains the event tables.
      - name: columns
        type: list
        description: The list of columns to keep.

  - name: get_event_relations

        description: The schema that contains the event tables.
      - name: min_rows

        description: Keep only tables with rows greater or equal to this value (default 100).
      - name: database
        type: string
        description: The database that contains the schema provided as the first argument.
